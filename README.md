## Abstract 
<details>
The Temperature Monitoring System is a digital project designed to measure and monitor
temperature levels in real-time. This system uses digital sensors, microcontrollers, and
display units to collect, process, and display temperature data. It can be used in labs after
some advancedments. It oĊers a practical application for various industries, including
environmental monitoring, healthcare, and industrial control. The project involves the
integration of a temperature sensor, counter IC, flip-flops, logic gates, a 7-segment LED
display, and power supply components on a breadboard or PCB. It performs various tasks like
it records and monitors temperature, it gives a security alarm when Temperature reaches
extremes. It displays the Temperature in both Celcius and Fahrenheit. It also displays the average
Temperature over 24hrs.
Our motivation is to provide safety measures and safe working conditions for employes. After some
advancements we can provide this setup for maintaining optimal Temperature in Industries to make
Industrial processes more effecient.
Our unique contribution is Hypothetically we can implement Alarms, maintain optimal temperature
and share data using bluetooth/WiFi
