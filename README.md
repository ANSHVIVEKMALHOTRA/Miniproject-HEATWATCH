# Miniproject-HEATWATCH
HEATWATCH(Temperature monitoring system)-[Digital and System Designs]


We as a team worked in this project for the course Digital and Systems design (course code - CS201)

The Temperature Monitoring System is a digital project designed to measure and monitor temperature levels in real-time. This system uses digital sensors, and display units to collect, process, and display temperature data. It can be used in labs after some advancedments. It oÄŠers a practical application for various industries, including environmental monitoring, healthcare, and industrial control. The project involves the integration of a temperature sensor, counter IC, flip-flops, logic gates, a 7-segment LED display, and power supply components on a breadboard or PCB. It performs various tasks like it records and monitors temperature, it gives a security alarm when Temperature reaches extremes. It displays the Temperature in both Celcius and Fahrenheit. It also displays the average Temperature over 24hrs and also alerts when the temperature exceeds over a certain temperature 

Our unique contribution is Hypothetically we can maintain optimal temperature and share data using bluetooth / WiFi.

## Languages and Simulator 
#LOGISM - Logism worked as simulator software that can be used for designing and testing logic circuits through a graphical user interface.

#Verilog - Verilog is a Hardware Description Language (HDL) for verification through simulation, for timing analysis, for test analysis (testability analysis and fault grading) and for logic synthesis.

## Unique Contribution
Our unique contribution to the project is that we are able to calculate the average temperature just by using basics of combinational circuits without even using higher memory elements.

## Components-used
#Temperature Sensor (e.g., LM35, LM75, or thermistor)

#Counter IC (e.g., 74LS90 or 74LS192).

#Flip-Flops (e.g., 74LS74).

#Logic Gates (e.g., 74LS00, 74LS32).

#Display (e.g., 7-segment LED display).

#Power supply components (voltage regulator, capacitors, etc.).

#Breadboard or PCB for circuit construction.

## Our Learning
This Project gives a good learning about Designing of Digital and Signal systems which opens up our knowledge in various types of IC (Integrated Circuit) chips, Logic gates, Sequential and Combinational circuits, Digital Integrated Circuits, Hardware modeling using VHDL,Logisim Simulation, Soldering, etc.
