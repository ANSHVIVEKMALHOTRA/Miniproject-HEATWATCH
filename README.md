# Miniproject-HEATWATCH
HEATWATCH(Temperature monitoring system)-[Digital and System Designs]

The Temperature Monitoring System is a digital project designed to measure and monitor temperature levels in real-time. This system uses digital sensors, and display units to collect, process, and display temperature data. It can be used in labs after some advancedments. It oÄŠers a practical application for various industries, including environmental monitoring, healthcare, and industrial control. The project involves the integration of a temperature sensor, counter IC, flip-flops, logic gates, a 7-segment LED display, and power supply components on a breadboard or PCB. It performs various tasks like it records and monitors temperature, it gives a security alarm when Temperature reaches extremes. It displays the Temperature in both Celcius and Fahrenheit. It also displays the average Temperature over 24hrs

#Components-used
Temperature Sensor (e.g., LM35, LM75, or thermistor)
-Counter IC (e.g., 74LS90 or 74LS192).
